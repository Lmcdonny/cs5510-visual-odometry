#### CS5510 Assignment 2: Visual Odometry Implementation

### 1. Implement Visual Odometry Algorithm

- Task: Develop a Python program to compute the visual odometry of the robot.
- Requirement: The program should be able to estimate the robotâ€™s trajectory by analyzing the camera images.

##### Our solution:

Install ORB_SLAM3 github [here](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3)

### 2. Navigate in a Circuit Around the Room

- Task: Using the basic mobility commands, make the robot move in a circuit around the room (can be teleop). Record the video and process off-board, stream the video to an offboard device, or use internal compute to calculate VO.

- Requirement: The circuit should be reasonably precise, and the robot should not drift significantly from the planned path. Record the video and odometry data from the robot's persepective.

####    Our solution:

Using circuit.py, the robot moves in a circle circuit and records the video in 'my_video.h264'. Afterward, we download the video from the robot to be used in our implementation of Task 1.

####    Required packages and files:
- picamera
- time
- cv2
- smbus
- Car.py (whose github can be found [here](https://github.com/DIRECTLab/raspbot-code))

####    Instructions:

1. Execute the program

    Place the robot in an open indoor area. On the robot, execute `circuit.py` and the robot will go forward for the previously specified amount of time and turn right.

2. Download the video

    Our method of downloading the video was as follows:

    a. Obtain the path on your robot leading to the video file

    b. On the device you wish to download the video to, type the following command into a bash shell:

        scp pi@[robot_ip]:[path_to_file] [new_file_location]

        ex: scp pi@192.168.137.71:/home/pi/assn2/my_video.h264 .

    In the above example, the file will be downloaded from the robot to your shell's current directory

3. Load into orbslam
    Run the following command in your orb-slam directory
    
        ./Examples/Monocular/mono_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/TUM1.yaml [PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER]

### 3. Analyze and Report

- Task: Analyze the recorded data and compare the estimated trajectory with the actual path taken by the robot. (You can use an estimate based on whatever)
- Requirement: Submit a comprehensive report detailing your findings, methodology, any challenges faced, and possible improvements.
